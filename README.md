# HRV-Arduino-interface
Interface between a HRV system and a home automation project (Domoticz example included)

It basically provides a web interface to configure network settings, read sensor values, dewpoint, efficiency and set fan speeds.

Currently supported:
2pc. AM2301 (DHT21) relative humidity sensor
4pc. 18B20 temperature sensor
2pc. 0-10V outputs for fan control

A matching circuit board design is also available
